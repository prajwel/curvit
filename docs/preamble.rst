Preamble
========

Curvit is an open-source python package to produce light curves from UVIT (Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope) data.  The events list from the **official UVIT L2 pipeline (version 6.3 onwards)** is required as input to the package. If you have data from old official pipeline versions or other pipelines, please get in touch with me, and we can try to figure out a solution!
